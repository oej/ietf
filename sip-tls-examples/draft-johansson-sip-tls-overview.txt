 SIP and TLS in published RFCs: Overview from an implementors point of

Abstract

   Use of TLS in the SIP protocol is defined in multiple documents,
   starting with RFC 3261.  As an implementor, the descriptions on how
   to use TLS in these RFCs is often incomplete and in some cases
   confusing.

   The idea with this overview is to show how different various RFCs
   describe use of TLS.  In order to avoid this, guidelines for authors
   of IETF documents involving TLS are needed.

   This document is not a complete overview and is not meant to be a
   standards track document.  It's meant to be input to the UTA working
   group f

1.  Introduction

   RFC 3261 [RFC3261] defines how to use TLS in the SIP protocol, but
   doesn't describe the actual verification between a SIP request and a
   TLS server certificate in detail.  RFC 5922 [RFC5922] updates RFC
   3261 with a definition of how a SIP client matches a PKIX X.509
   [RFC5280] certificate provided by a TLS-enabled SIP server with the
   domain of a SIP request that caused the connection to be set up.
   Verification is done using the domain part of the SIP URI and the
   X.509 SubjectAltName extension of type dNSName or
   uniformResourceIdentifier.  This is called "domain verification" as
   opposed to "host verification" in RFC 5922.

   Including all domains hosted by a server in a server's certificate
   doesn't provide for a scalable and easy-managed solution.  Every time
   a service adds a domain, a new certificate will need to be provided,
   unless TLS Server Name Identification (SNI) is used, where each
   domain can have it's own certificate.  Having one certificate per
   domain and subdomain adds to the administration of a service.  In
   addition, no known commercial CA offers certificate services with SIP
   URI's in the certificates.

   Using DNSsec and DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities
   (DANE)[RFC6698] the chain from a SIP uri to a TLS certificate

   changes, as outlined in this document.  With DNSsec, the DNS lookups
   are authenticated and can be verified and trusted.
   [I-D.ietf-dane-srv] describes a DANE-based chain of trust, matching
   the SRV host name with the contents of the certificate.

2.  The big divide - provider provided security or user-controlled
    security?

   SIP has footholds in two very different worlds.  It's the old
   bellhead vs nethead discussion all over again, something that shows
   when looking at security solutions for SIP.  Some of them are
   traditionally Telco-focused, where the service provider provides
   security for the users, asking the users to trust the service to
   handle keys, certificates and process signaling and media
   unencrypted.  The traditional datacom side, to take it to the
   extreme, is that only end users can manage their own security.
   Security needs to be end to end in this world.  These trust or "no-
   trust" perspectives affects the proposals and makes it hard to get an
   overview of a single "SIP Security Architecture" - because it doesn't
   exist.  In true IETF spirit, there are many and in some cases
   incompatible, proposals.

   The SIP architecture has been developed during more than 10 years and
   the SIP security framework has been added to in a large amount of
   RFCs, that doesn't always match when combined into one solution.  The
   addition of SIP outbound, Gruus, SIP connection reuse and the
   clarification of the SIPS uri has been huge steps forward in
   providing a solution where TLS can be used in production, compared
   with the initial specification in RFC 3261.

   There are RFCs that indicates a need for security but doesn't provide
   the developer with any clear directives.  This document tries to
   build a combined picture of the current state of SIP security to
   provide a basis for further work in order to both build a more clear
   framework that can be used to provide running code, and to find
   issues that still needs solutions.

   The document doesn't focus on attack scenarios, media security or
   issues with encryption algorithms or protocols.

Appendix A.  Appendix A. Implementation notes

   Developers of SIP implementations are strongly encouraged to
   implement RFC 5922 and this document for secure verification of a SIP
   domain with a TLS server.  This document also encourages
   implementation of TLS SNI both in client and server implementations.
   In order to get support of this function, update to new versions of
   the TLS libraries and make sure that the implementation supports new
   versions of TLS - TLS 1.1 [RFC4346] and TLS 1.2 [RFC5246].
